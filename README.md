##Gym management system

###Introduction

The MyGym app was a porject for buidling a multi model Rail app. 

The idea behind the MyGym app is that it could be used the owner of gym to provide not only a website for their business but it would also help with administration, communication, organistaion and motivation of members. The sytem allows:

* New members to register on line

* There is a full password secure administraion suite built in
* QR code technology to generate a membership card which could be linked to a door entry system or turnstile. 
* The membership card ccould in a future release be linked to membership fee payment records. 
* Owners can maintain a list of different membership types and functionality to record payments could be added in future
* Peronal Trainers and Teachers can add edit and update classes they provide
* There is a secure messaging system which means trainers and members do not have to use theri personal email, messages or mobile number for communication
* The sytem can provide motivation through simple statistics on user visits, this could be liked to motivational remindr messages in future
